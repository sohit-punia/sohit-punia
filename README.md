## ✨ About Me

* 🌱 I'm in my 5th semester of B.Tech (Electrical & Computer Engineering) at Kurukshetra University.
* 💻 Focus: MERN stack, backend & APIs, and building clean, usable web apps.
* 🧠 Passionate about DSA — I'm doing **#100DaysOfCode** (one problem a day) to level up. Every DSA post includes `#codewithsohit` and `#sohitsolvedsa`.
* 🌳 For tree problems I add a tree emoji at the start of my post: `🌳`.

## 🧩 My #100DaysOfCode Rules

* I solve **one DSA problem per day** and post the solution on GitHub/LinkedIn.
* Always include these hashtags: `#codewithsohit` `#sohitsolvedsa`.
* Add `🌳` before the title when it's a tree-related problem.
